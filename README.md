## Overview
This project simulates the obstacles from NASA's HERC competition, enabling teams to practice and refine their rover control strategies. The environment (as planned) includes:
- Rough terrains and materials
- Strategically placed obstacles
- Craters and inclines
- Crevasses and other terrains

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **ROS 2 (Foxy, Humble, or Rolling)**
- **Gazebo (Garden or compatible versions)**
- **colcon build system**
- **Python 3.8+**

To install ROS 2 and Gazebo, follow the official setup guides:
- [ROS 2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html)
- [Gazebo installation guide](https://gazebosim.org/docs)
